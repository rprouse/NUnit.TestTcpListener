# NUnit.TestTcpListener
A test TcpListener for listening to NUnit.Xamarin test events

Code was originally provided by [Roubachof](https://github.com/roubachof) with his pull request to 
the [NUnit.Xamarin project](https://github.com/nunit/nunit.xamarin/) adding a TcpWriter allowing that
code to be tested.
